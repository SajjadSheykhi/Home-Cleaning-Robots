Many people are living increasingly busy lives. Household cleaning is a large time commitment
especially for people already preoccupied balancing demanding careers and busy personal
lives. The average American spends nearly 2 hours per day doing household tasks ranging from
cooking (and the clean up that comes with it), to household cleaning and laundry [1]. The
average American also spends over 300 hours annually on household cleaning which takes up
nearly 40% of their week [2]. In addition “half of Americans admit to falling behind in cleaning
their home” [2]. Americans also spend a significant amount of time indoors. The Environmental
Protection Agency notes that Americans will spend about 90% of their time indoors [4], where
concentrations of pollutants are anywhere from two to five times higher than they are outdoors
[3]. This can be cause for major health concerns, especially for those with allergies or
sensitivities. The aforementioned factors mark a clear need for a reliable and efficient solution
that can autonomously manage housekeeping.
A multi-functional cleaning system offers an innovative solution, which allows individuals to
maintain a cleaner and healthier living environment without constant manual labor. We propose
a robotic system that can handle floor cleaning, window cleaning, toilet cleaning and air
purification. The primary customer for this system is anyone looking for a time-saving, efficient
cleaning solution, such as families, pet owners, busy professionals between the ages of 25-55,
and elderly individuals. Individuals who live in suburban and urban areas alike can use this
system as it’s ideal for fast-paced lifestyles and those looking for a space efficient. Secondary
stakeholders include: investors in home automation, developers in home technology,
policymakers in government who handle smart home standards, and the general public that will
benefit from this sustainable, smart home solution.
Customers currently rely on a variety of robots that act as standalone solutions for specific home
cleaning tasks. Popular products include Roomba robotic vacuums and mops, which provide
floor cleaning solutions in a variety of models [5]. Other products include air purifiers from
brands like Dyson that aim to improve indoor air quality by capturing pollutants. These products
function well in helping to remedy some of the burdens surrounding home cleaning but are
usually only aimed towards one specific function, which leaves gaps within the overall cleaning
process.
Many current products lack an integrated, multi-functional approach to home cleaning, which
requires users to manage a number of different devices manually or through various
applications to maintain a comprehensive cleaning routine. Our proposed robotic system aims
to address these shortcomings by integrating various specialized robots that work
collaboratively to cover several cleaning tasks including: floor and window cleaning, air
purification, and toilet cleaning. By filling these gaps, our system aspires to deliver a more
seamless, easy, and complete solution for household cleaning, enhancing efficiency for users
while also addressing health and lifestyle needs holistically.
